            <div translate>
              The game is free but the team has to finance its needs. Indeed
              servers and domain names are not free. For this we have set up a
              favor system, buying a favor will allow you to help the game and
              get various benefits. For this we use several payment systems like
              paypal and Mobiyo.
            </div>
            <div translate>
              From the beginning, the game has always managed to self-fund. If
              you want to help us, the best thing you can do is send the game
              link to your friends. Our best reward is to know that the site you
              like.

            <h2 class="text-center" translate>Functioning of the Favors</h2>

            <p translate>
              When purchasing through the payment system, your account is
              credited with one or more favors. These will allow you to get
              bonuses in the game. In order not to disadvantage those who do not
              take favors, these can be exchanged between players. You can also
              get favors by inviting friends to sign up on Ellas War via
              sponsorship or by games regularly held on the facebook page.
