            You can't attack a player who is in the same alliance than you
          </li>
          <li translate>
            You can't attack a player that your alliance has a pact with

            You can't attack the same player more than two days in a row
            (anti-bashing)
          </li>
          <li translate>
            You can attack cities that have between 50% and 200% of your field
          </li>
          <li translate>
            You can attack cities that have a maximum 4 levels of difference
            with you, except if both players have a field larger or equal to 25000
          </li>
          <li translate>
            The field rule doesn't apply if the targeted player has the diamond

            The difference between offensive and defensive strength is used to
            calculate building destruction and resource plunder.

        <strong translate>War attacks</strong>
        <ul>

            The previous rule about antibashing doesn't apply anymore
          </li>
          <li translate>
            If you have under 8.000 of field, you can attack all the players
            that are under 8.000 too. The level rule still applies.
          </li>
          <li translate>
            Attacking a player via the diamond needs to repect the field rule to
            count as a war attack
