# Ellas War

Ellas War is an online Video Game started in 2007. The action takes place approximately to -500 during the Golden Age of ancient Greece. When we have migrated the frontend from AngularJS to Angular, we have decided to release it under a free license. Officially supported languages are English and French, but we are open to contributions.

## Development

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Because of CSR problems you might be able to connect only to the development server.

### Running tests

Run `ng test --code-coverage` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Scan with SonarQube

To scan the code and export the results to SonarQube, run `npm run sonar`.

## Production
